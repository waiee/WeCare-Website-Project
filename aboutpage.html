        1.To create an appropriate platform for sharing their problem To reach
        people who are in need of a safe place or someone to share what is going
        on in their mind. This feature could help someone kill their trust
        issues towards people. Other than that, it is also for helping someone
        to avoid bumping into a judgemental person who will influence them
        towards negative thoughts and give them motivation words for being brave
        in telling what they feel.

        2.To provide an easier platform for users to make donations. To
        encourage people to donate their money to help the poor with mental
        health issues. Some people having the same issue would have wanted to
        help others but not knowing how and where. This is a place where people
        can donate their money to help people with mental health illnesses. Let
        people have the power to improve the lives of others and hope for
        positive effects to give support to the poor people to live a better
        life.
